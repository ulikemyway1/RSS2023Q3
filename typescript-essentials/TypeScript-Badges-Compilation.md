## My personal Reflections on what I have learned during my TypeScript Journey

1. **Get started with TypeScript**:
> The ‘Get Started with TypeScript’ module provides information about what TypeScript is and why this programming language is widely used for JavaScript development. From a practical perspective, this module provides information on how to install TypeScript and how to compile .ts files into .js files. I believe that this module is a good choice for starting to learn TypeScript.
2. **Declare variable types in TypeScript**:
> In this module, I learned about basic TypeScript types such as number, string, Boolean, object, union, enums, any, and unknown. This module provides information on how to declare these types and their possible use cases. In my opinion, this module gives information which can be sufficient to add types into a JS application at a basic level.
3. **Implement interfaces in TypeScript**:
> This module introduces another TypeScript feature – interfaces. Interfaces are useful to describe the point of contact between any two pieces of TypeScript code and they also allow us to catch errors and make sure that we are passing the right parameters at compile time. In my development work, I consider using interfaces to describe the rules of interactions between parts of an application and an external API.
4. **Develop typed functions by using TypeScript**
> This module introduces typing functions. I learned how to create function types that have required, optional, default, and rest parameters using TypeScript. This approach is very convenient and the gained knowledge can be used in almost all of my future applications. Therefore, because functions are widely used, it is very important to make their use as safe as possible.
