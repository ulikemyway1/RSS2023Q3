## My personal Reflections on what I have learned during my TypeScript Journey

1. **Get started with TypeScript**:
> The ‘Get Started with TypeScript’ module provides information about what TypeScript is and why this programming language is widely used for JavaScript development. From a practical perspective, this module provides information on how to install TypeScript and how to compile .ts files into .js files. I believe that this module is a good choice for starting to learn TypeScript.
