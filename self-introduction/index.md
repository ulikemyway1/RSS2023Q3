Hello! I’m Alex, and I want to be a frontend developer.

I live in Minsk, Belarus. My background is in chemical technology, and I even have a PhD in Material Science.

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by computers. When my family got our first computer when I was 6, it became a big part of my life. At first, I just played games like DOOM and Prince of Persia. But gradually, I started learning how computers work and even fixed them sometimes.

My first steps in programming were creating small programs in Pascal and making a website about my hometown. I really enjoyed it! But then I focused on chemistry.
As a chemical engineer and scientist, I gained a lot of useful skills such as discipline, time management, cooperation, and became more goal-oriented. It was a fascinating journey and a valuable experience.

But recently, I decided to dive back into programming. I took a Udemy course called “Web Programming” and learned about modern web technologies like HTML5, CSS, and basic JavaScript. I’ve already built several websites during that course.

In the summer of 2023 I saw a post about Rolling Scopes School. Then I became an Rolling Scopes School student. I’ve completed stage 0 and am now working on stage 1.
During my time at Rolling Scopes School, I’ve been working on different projects using various technologies. Let me briefly share some of them with you.

The word game. This app is designed to learn English words in a playful way. The player’s goal is to choose the correct pair of words. The application is created in native JavaScript. It contains more than 8 thousand words. The app includes various game modes and the record table. LocalStorage is used to store user information. Design is responsive and adapted for both desktop and mobile devices.

Image Gallery. This application displays images as requested by the user. This is my first work experience with data API. I used Unsplash API under the app’s hood. Design is also responsive and adapted for desktop and mobile devices.

Nonograms. This picture logic puzzle is also known as Pic-a-Pix. The player's task is to restore the hidden picture. In this project, I used modular archeitecture and Webpack for bundling.

I really love what I do here at Rolling Scopes School. Programming and related problem-solving inspire me. I have strong motivation to complete this course and continue to gain even more knowledge to become a front-end developer.

Thank you for your attention!
